## `cd` command
---

1. `cd` with no argument - run in /home - no error
   Nothing happens. the `cd` command seems to need an argument to a path we can change to. Passing in no argument lets us stay in our working directory.
2. `cd` with path to directory as argument - run in /home - no error
   Our working directory is changed to our specified directory. Our new working directory is shown on the left terminal prompt in green.
3. `cd` with path to file as argument - run in /home/lecture1 - error
   An error message pops up saying that our passed in argument is not a directory. Apparently, only directory paths can be passed as arguments to the `cd` command.

## `ls` command
---

1. `ls` with no argument - run in /home - no error
   The `ls` command without any arguments lists out all directory and file names in our working directory.
2. `ls` with path to directory as argument - run in /home - no error
   The `ls` command with a directory as argument lists out all directory and file names in the directory passed as an argument.
3. `ls` with path to file as argument - run in /home/lecture1 - no error
   The `ls` command with a file as argument seems to just print out the file name that was passed in.

## `cat` command
